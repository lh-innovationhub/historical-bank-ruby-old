      # ==== Parameters
      # - +oer_app_id+ - App ID for the OpenExchangeRates API access
      # - +base_currency+ - The base currency that will be used for the OER requests. It should be a +Money::Currency+ object.
      # - +timeout+ - The timeout in seconds to set on the requests
      # - +oer_account_type+ - The OpenExchangeRates account type. Should be one of +AccountType::FREE+, +DEVELOPER+, +ENTERPRISE+, or +UNLIMITED+

      # It returns a +Hash+ with the rates for each quote currency and date
      # as shown in the example. Rates are +BigDecimal+.
      #
      # ==== Parameters
      #
      # - +date+ - +date+ for which the rates are requested. Minimum +date+ is January 1st 1999, as defined by the OER API (https://docs.openexchangerates.org/docs/api-introduction). Maximum +date+ is yesterday (UTC), as today's rates are not final (https://openexchangerates.org/faq/#timezone).
      #            If Enterprise or Unlimited account in openexchangerates.org, the +date+'s month is the month for which we request rates
      #
      # ==== Errors
      #
      # - Raises +ArgumentError+ when +date+ is less than January 1st 1999, or greater than yesterday (UTC)
      # - Raises +Money::RatesProvider::RequestFailed+ when the OER request fails
      #
      # ==== Examples
