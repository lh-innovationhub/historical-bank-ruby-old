## Steps

1. Fork the repo
2. Grab dependencies: `bundle install`
3. Make sure specs are green: us e.g. `brew services start redis` the run Redis server and then `bundle exec rspec` to run the specs.
4. Make your changes
5. Run `rubocop -a`
6. Make sure specs are still green
7. Update `CHANGELOG.md` and `AUTHORS`
8. Issue a Pull Request and link any relevant issues


## Tips

Please make sure you read [README.md](README.md) before you start hacking so that you understand how the gem works :)

### Redis usage

The Redis cache that we use stores Hashes with keys formatted as `[namespace]:[base_currency]:[quote_currency]`.
These hashes contain ISO dates as keys with base currency rates as values.
For example, if `currency` is the Redis namespace we used in the config,
USD is the base currency, and we're looking for HUF rates, they can be found in the `currency:USD:HUF` key, and their format will be
```
{
  "2016-05-01": "0.272511002E3", # Rates are stored as BigDecimal Strings
  "2016-05-02": "0.270337998E3",
  "2016-05-03": "0.271477498E3"
}
```

The first key of this Hash translates to: "on May 1st 2016, 1 USD was equivalent to 272.511002 HUF".


### Memory caching

Apart from Redis, rates are also cached in the Bank's memory,
in `@rates`. `@rates` is a `Hash[iso_currency][iso_date]`
containing `BigDecimal` exchange rates of `iso_currency` on `iso_date`.
When they don't exist in memory, they are retrieved from the Store,
and when they don't exist in the Store, they are retrieved from the
Provider.


## Possible improvements

- Make Redis optional
- Add another provider (e.g. XE.com)
- Add another store (e.g. DynamoDB, MongoDB, Cassandra, Postgres, etc)
